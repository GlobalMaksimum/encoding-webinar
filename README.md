# Welcome to Encoding Techniques Webinar

Notebooks from **A Tutorial on Encoding Techniques** webinar as a part of **Machine Learning and AI in Covid19 Days** webinar series.

### This seminar explores the concepts of:

#### 1. Encoding

Encoding is the process of converting the data or a given sequence of characters, symbols, alphabets etc., into a specified format, for the secured transmission of data. 

#### 2. Categorical Variables

A categorical variable is a variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed number of possible values.

There are several different types of categorical data including:

- **Binary Variable:** A variable that has only 2 values. For example, True/False or Yes/No.
- **Ordinal Variable:** A variable that has some order associated with it like our place example above.
- **Nominal Variable:** A variable that has no numerical importance, for example color or city.

#### 3. Common Techniques for Encoding Categorical Data

Many machine learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data directly. They require data to be numeric. Therefore, it is essential to know how to encode categorical variables.

The encoding techniques that are covered in the are the following:

- Replacing Values
- Label Encoding
- One Hot Encoding
- Ordinal Encoding
- Binary Encoding
- BaseN Encoding
- Thermometer (Unary) Encoding
- Frequency Encoding
- Target (Mean) Encoding
- K-Fold Target Encoding
- Weight of Evidence Encoding
- Cyclic Encoding
